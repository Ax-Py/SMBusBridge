# SMBusBridge
This project involves developing a system using an AVR microcontroller to convert UART data into SMBus protocol. The AVR reads serial data from a UART interface, processes it, and then transmits the data over SMBus. This conversion allows devices with different communication protocols to interface seamlessly, enabling efficient data exchange in embedded systems.

Key Features

- Error Checking: Ensures data integrity during transmission.
- Data Rate Adjustment: Adapts to different communication speeds.
- Protocol Translation: Facilitates seamless interfacing between UART and SMBus.
- Reliability: Maintains consistent and stable communication.
