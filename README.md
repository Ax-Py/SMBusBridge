# SMBusBridge
This project involves developing a system using an ATMega328P microcontroller to convert UART data into SMBus protocol. The ATMega328P reads serial data from a UART interface, processes it, and then transmits the data over SMBus. This conversion allows devices with different communication protocols to interface seamlessly, enabling efficient data exchange in embedded systems and sensors. Compatible with all serial terminal programs and programming languages such as Python and C#.

Key Features

- Error Checking: Ensures data integrity during transmission.
- Data Rate Adjustment: Adapts to different communication speeds.
- Protocol Translation: Facilitates seamless interfacing between UART and SMBus.
- Reliability: Maintains consistent and stable communication.
